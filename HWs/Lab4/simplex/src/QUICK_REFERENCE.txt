GOAL: Find minimum-cost path from A to G
FLOW: 1 unit from source to destination
COST: Minimize total distance traveled
```

### Problem 2: Maximum Flow  
```
FILE: flow_network.txt
GOAL: Find maximum flow from A to G
FLOW: 5 units from source to destination
COST: Maximize total throughput

## 🔧 How To Run

```bash
# Shortest Path
./a.exe shortest_path.txt

# Flow Network
./a.exe flow_network.txt
```

---

## 📌 Key Constraints

### Both Files Enforce:
- ✓ Flow conservation at all intermediate nodes
- ✓ Supply constraint at source A
- ✓ Demand constraint at destination G
- ✓ Non-negativity of all variables
- ✓ Proper network connectivity

## 🎓 Example Interpretations

### Shortest Path Output Example:
```
Objective Value: 10
x₁ = 0
x₂ = 0
x₃ = 1 ← Path A→D
x₄ = 0
x₅ = 0
x₆ = 0
x₇ = 1 ← Path D→E
x₈ = 0
x₉ = 1 ← Path E→G
x₁₀ = 0
x₁₁ = 0
x₁₂ = 0

Shortest path: A → D → E → G
Total cost: 7 + 1 + 2 = 10
```

### Flow Network Output Example:
```
Objective Value: -5 (means max flow = 5)
x₁ = 2.5  ← 2.5 units A→B
x₂ = 2.5  ← 2.5 units A→C
x₃ = 0
x₄ = 0
x₅ = 0
x₆ = 5    ← 5 units C→F
x₇ = 0
x₈ = 0
x₉ = 0
x₁₀ = 5   ← 5 units F→G
x₁₁ = 0
x₁₂ = 0

Total flow reached: 5 units
```
